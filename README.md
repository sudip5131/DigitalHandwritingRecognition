# digitalHandwritingRecognition" 

PROJECT IDEA
This project emphasizes on digitization of handwritten documents. Direct digitization of
handwritten documents can save a huge load of time and effort.
This project targets handwritten digits and correctly predicts the digit visible in each image.
Comparing the handwritten digits with those already in the Database, we calculate the percentage
resemblance of the handwritten digits and thus predict the visible digit. By utilizing the data
provided by MNIST, we decided to predict which digit is visible in each image.
The objective is to train a multi-layered neural network to identify the handwritten digits.
